🔹 The Problem
The Public Distribution System (PDS) faces fraud, inefficiencies, and corruption, preventing essential food supplies from reaching those in need. Manual errors lead to inventory fraud, fake ration cards, and weight discrepancies, while lack of transparency allows middlemen to manipulate records.

🔹 The Blockchain Solution
✅ Decentralized Ledger – Records transactions securely, eliminating middlemen.
✅ Smart Contracts – Automates ration allocation and prevents tampering.
✅ Transparency & Auditability – Enables real-time tracking of food distribution.

🔹 How It Works
🔗 Tamper-proof Blocks – Each transaction is stored securely.
🔗 P2P Validation & Consensus Algorithms – Ensures authenticity using PoW, PoS, LPoS, PoET.
🔗 SHA-256 Hashing – Protects data integrity.
🔗 Mining Process – Validates transactions before adding them to the blockchain.

🔹 Key Benefits
✔️ Eliminates middlemen fraud
✔️ Automated, tamper-proof transactions
✔️ End-users can track entitlements in real-time
✔️ Self-recovery from failures ensures reliability

🔹 Challenges & Future Scope
❌ High computational & implementation costs
❌ Scalability concerns & regulatory challenges
📌 Future improvements: AI-driven fraud detection, optimized consensus, and interoperability with other e-Governance systems.

💡 Blockchain can revolutionize ration distribution, ensuring fairness, security, and efficiency!
